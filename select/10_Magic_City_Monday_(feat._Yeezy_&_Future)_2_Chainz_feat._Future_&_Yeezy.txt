Yeah, that truck backin' up
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa!

Bitch we ain't playin' 'bout that money
We got 'em wrapped up like a mummy
That Presidential lookin' sunny

Jizzle is the name, hustlin' is the game
Might just walk up out of Neiman's and go buy me a plane
If you playin' 'bout this paper, then you don't know me, honey
The clique don't do no holsters, we standin' on the sofa
And we be in them Rolls, the ones that come with chauffeurs
Who the fuck the DJ? He playin' all my hits
Money's the agenda, we mix it like a blender
Got ten off in the fender, with steps up in the center

Bitch we ain't playin' 'bout that money
We got 'em wrapped up like a mummy
That Presidential lookin' sunny

Hop up out the bando, hop up out the Lambo
Got my Cuban links on, they gon' need a passport
I'm doin' the dashboard, paid $300 cash for it
Came in the backdoor, skin color rim
Man the bitch keep rubbin' on me, I'ma turn into a genie
Got that Magic City flow, got that money on the floor
I'm so close to the club, I damn near parked on the floor
It's a line at the door, niggas lyin' at the door
Hit the hotel suite and put the sign on the door

Bitch we ain't playin' 'bout that money
We got 'em wrapped up like a mummy

I got the retail on 'em
By the time it get to you it got detail on it
We got that fishscale on it
By the time it get to you it got seashells on it
You know what I represent
Everything I whip up, yeah it gotta be foreign
We wrap it up like a mummy
Finessin' and wrappin' up dummy
I got a plug on the girl
But I know, I know you tellin'
I gotta shit on you first, cause I know you jealous
I had to jump off the porch, now I'm fully developed
Baller status, absolutely, top back, no roof
They search around for the street fare
They'll never have a clue

Bitch we ain't playin' 'bout that money
We got 'em wrapped up like a mummy
That Presidential lookin' sunny

Super
Who you know run up the check like that?
Who you know run up the check like that?
Who you know run up a tab like that?
Hendrix! Hendrix!

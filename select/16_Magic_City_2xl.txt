Boy, I know a place you'll never wanna leave
Not only in your dreams it's reality
Do you wanna go to magic city with me?
With me?
Anything I want, (I'll try it)
What I need, (You got it)
A little dance, (I'll dance for ya)
Oh, for real? (No problem)
Anything you got, (if you want it)
That's what I need, (I gotcha boy)
Do that dance dance dance
Come to magic city with me

I'm from the west, but I lean and I rock
In the club, 20 G's in the watch
Shortys hard, I gotta make her mine for the night
She got an apple bottom, my momma feed her right
I'm like, "My name is Royal City girl
And I was wonderin' if you would take me to your world
Heard that there's a place you got
That both me and you could go
I won't let my momma know
We could keep it on the low
So it's on bring me to your city girl
I could be your volunteer, you'll be my magician girl"
Back to the room, she put me on the chair
Just a touch of magic her jeans disappear

Boy, I know a place you'll never wanna leave
Not only in your dreams it's reality
Do you wanna go to magic city with me?
With me?
Anything I want, (I'll try it)
What I need, (You got it)
A little dance, (I'll dance for ya)
Oh, for real? (No problem)
Anything you got, (if you want it)
That's what I need, (I gotcha boy)
Do that dance dance dance
Come to magic city with me

One minute, two minute, three minute, four
She dancin' for me now she's somethin' like a pro
Call her Miss Houdini cause she's magic with her lips
Like abracadabra she know where to kiss
That's somethin' I ain't never seen before
By the way she move I gotta put her in my video
This is magic city, my personal fantasy world
Where I could do whatever with my fantasy girl
It's 12 o'clock so she know, (how I roll)
By one o'clock, she gonna (take it to the floor)
Just like magic, (take it down low)
Take me to your magic place, baby I ain't tryin' to wait

Boy, I know a place you'll never wanna leave
Not only in your dreams it's reality
Do you wanna go to magic city with me?
With me?
Anything I want, (I'll try it)
What I need, (You got it)
A little dance, (I'll dance for ya)
Oh, for real? (No problem)
Anything you got, (if you want it)
That's what I need, (I gotcha boy)
Do that dance dance dance
Come to magic city with me

Like hocus pocus give me one wish
Take me away be my magical chick
Im'a go to magic city with you
So baby come to magic city with me
Like hocus pocus give me one wish
Take me away with your magical tricks
Im'a go to magic city with you
So baby come to magic city with me

Boy, I know a place you'll never wanna leave
Not only in your dreams it's reality
Do you wanna go to magic city with me?
